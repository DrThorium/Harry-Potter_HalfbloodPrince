Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Annoyance,0.4,Hermione  meanwhile  was resolutely plowing on with what she called the 'official' instructions  but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Friendship,0.8,Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them  Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did  and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Annoyance,0.7,Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron  who was trying to read it upside down.

Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Friendship,0.8,"Right "" said Harry  who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention  and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Friendship,0.9,"So  Harry "" said Dumbledore  in a businesslike voice. ""You have been wondering  I am sure  what I have planned for you dur-ing these �� for want of a better word �� lessons?"

Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,1.0,"And so I did "" said Dumbledore placidly. ""I told you everything I know. From this point forth  we shall be leaving the firm founda-tion of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Friendship,0.9,"But you think you're right?"" said Harry"

Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"Should've made your presence known  shouldn't you?"""
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Ogden, Morfin Gaunt",Disgust,1.0,"Defend himself against what  man?"""
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.5,You understand him  I'm sure  Harry?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Mr. Gaunt",Anger,0.9,All right  all right  all right! Come in the bleeding house  then  and much good it'll do you!
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Ogden, Mr. Gaunt",Resolute,0.8,Yes  Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl …
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Merope",Sad,0.9,"Mr. Gaunt  please!"" said Ogden in a shocked voice  as Merope  who had already picked up the pot  flushed blotchily scarlet  lost her grip on the pot again1 drew her wand shakily from her pocket  pointed it at the pot  and muttered a hasty  inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her  hit the op-posite wall  and crack in two"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Merope",Anger,0.8,"Pick it up!"" Gaunt bellowed at her. ""That's it  grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle  what's your wand for  you useless sack of muck?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Merope",Disgust,0.9,"orfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed  ""Mend it  you pointless lump  mend it!"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Ogden, Merope",Gratitude,0.8,"Reparo. "" The pot mended itself instantly"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"I heard you the first time!"" snapped Gaunt. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'"" Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice  making it pompous and singsong. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"What's that  then  his sentence?"" said Gaunt  his voice rising angrily. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"And you think we're scum  do you?"" screamed Gaunt  advanc-ing on Ogden now  with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"That's right!"" roared Gaunt. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family  that's how far back we go  and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this  with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?"" "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,With a howl of rage  Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second  Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment  he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Morfin",Fear,0.7,"Be quiet  boy "" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue  and Morfin fell silent again"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Anger,1.0,"Ar  I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you "" sneered Gaunt  and he spat on the floor again"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Ogden",Betrayal,0.8,"That's hardly the point  is it  Mr. Gaunt?"" said Ogden doggedly"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Merope, Gaunt",Fear,0.7,"Mr. Gaunt  your daughter!"" said Ogden in alarm  but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him  back to her corner  massaging her neck and gulping for air"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Tom Riddle, Cecilia",Disgust,0.9,Don't look at it  Cecilia  darling.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Merope",Envy,0.7,"Darling ' whispered Morfin in Parseltongue  looking at his sister. ""'Darling  he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway."
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Morfin",Fear,0.8,"What's that?"" said Gaunt sharply  also in Parseltongue  looking from his son to his daughter. ""What did you say  Morfin?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Merope",Fear,0.9,"Is it true?"" said Gaunt in a deadly voice  advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. ""My daughter��pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin �� hankering after a filthy  dirt-veined Muggle?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Merope",Betrayal,0.9,"But I got him  Father!"" cackled Morfin. ""I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him  did he  Merope?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Gaunt, Merope, Harry Potter",Anger,1.0,"You disgusting little Squib  you filthy little blood traitor!"" roared Gaunt  losing control  and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Ogden, Gaunt",Fear,1.0,"No!"" yelled Ogden and raised his wand and cried  ""Relaskio!"" "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Morfin, Ogden",Anger,1.0,orfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden  brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. 
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.5,"oth Harry and Dumbledore yelled ""No!"" at the same time and Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow. "
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Friendship,0.8,umbledore took Harry by the elbow and tugged. 
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Gratitude,0.6,arry obeyed  Merope's screams echoing in his ears
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.9,"Very good indeed "" said Dumbledore  beaming"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,0.8,Yes  that was Tom Riddle senior  the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret  burning passion.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.7,"I think you are forgetting "" said Dumbledore  ""that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban  once she was alone and free for the first time in her life  then  I am sure  she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years."
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.8,Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion  and fall in love with her instead?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.7,"The Imperius Curse?"" Harry suggested. ""Or a love potion?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,0.9,Very good.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.7,Personally  I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her  and I do not think it would have been very difficult  some hot day  when Riddle was riding alone  to persuade him to take a drink of water.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.8,In any case  within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed  the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter  Merope.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.7,But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban  expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead  he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell  explaining what she had done.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.8,From all that I have been able to discover  he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her de-sertion may have contributed to his early death �� or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo  and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.7,But Merope? She .. . she died  didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,0.8,"Yes  indeed "" said Dumbledore"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.7,We must do a certain amount of guessing here  although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see  within a few months of their runaway marriage  Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighbor-hood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant  I am sure  is that he had been under an enchant-ment that had now lifted  though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying  however  the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle  pretending that she was going to have his baby  and that he had married her for this reason.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.8,But she did have his baby.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Surprise,0.7,But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.8,"What went wrong?"" asked Harry. ""Why did the love potion stop working?"
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,0.9,"Again  this is guesswork "" said Dumbledore  ""but I believe that Merope  who was deeply in love with her husband  could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps  besotted as she was  she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so  she was wrong on both counts. He left her  never saw her again  and never troubled to discover what became of his son."
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,1.0,Sir  is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Friendship,0.8,Sir  am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,1.0,Sir  that ring...
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Friendship,1.0,You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Gratitude,1.0,Too late  Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Surprise,0.5,But how come �� ? Have you always had it?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore",Curiosity,0.8,Sir  how exactly �� ?
Chapter 10 - The house of count.txt,"Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter",Friendship,1.0,Around that time  yes  Harry.
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Fear,1.0,"He's a Death Eater "" said Harry slowly. ""He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!"""
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Fear,1.0,"Your scar's not hurting again  is it?"" asked Ron nervously."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Anxiety,1.0,"Harry?"" said Hermione in an anxious voice. ""What's wrong?"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Molly Weasley, Harry Potter",Happy,0.7,"Ah  Harry!"" said Mrs. Weasley loudly  cutting across Fleur's monologue."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Ron Weasley, Fleur",Disgust,0.9,"She has let 'erself go  zat Tonks "" Fleur mused  examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Molly Weasley, Fleur",Tarty,0.8,"Yes  thank you "" said Mrs. Weasley tartly  cutting across Fleur again."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Auror",Fear,0.8,"Quick  quick  through the barrier "" said Mrs. Weasley  who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. ""Harry had better go first  with ?quot;"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Friendship,0.9,"I can walk  thanks "" said Harry irritably  jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Sad,0.7,"We can't  Harry "" said Hermione  looking apologetic. ""Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit."
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Arthur Weasley",Friendship,1.0,"When we were in Diagon Alley "" Harry began  but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace."" "
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Arthur Weasley",Amusement,0.5,"Very well  then  let's hear the worst."" "
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Arthur Weasley",Resignation,0.8,"Of course you did "" said Mr. Weasley  sounding resigned. ""Well? Did you find out why?"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Ginny",Friendship,0.8,He waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view  then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage  but Ginny was a little way along the corridor  chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her  dragging his trunk.
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Arthur Weasley, Harry Potter",Gratitude,0.7,"You'd better hurry!' said Mr. Weasley  as Mrs. Weasley cried  ""Harry  quickly!"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Molly Weasley, Harry Potter",Friendship,0.9,"Now  dear  you're coming to us for Christmas  it's all fixed with Dumbledore  so we'll see you quite soon "" said Mrs. Weasley through the window  as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. ""You make sure you look after yourself and ?quot"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Arthur Weasley",Anger,0.9,"Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn't do?"" asked Harry angrily. ""Mr. Weasley  I'm sorry  but isn't it worth investigating?"
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Neville",Happy,0.7,Fancy trying to find a compartment?
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Ginny, Harry Potter",Sad,0.8,I can't  Harry  I said I'd meet Dean. See you later.
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Neville",Friendship,0.8,Neville! said Harry in relief  turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.
Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Luna",Friendship,0.8,Luna  hi  how are you?

Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Luna",Friendship,0.7,"People expect you to have cooler friends than us "" said Luna  once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty"

Chapter 7 - The Slug Club.txt,"Harry Potter, Cho Chang",Surprise,0.7,As Harry passed the window  he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta  who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face.
